# TopologicalTreeOfShapes
Computation of the Topological Tree of Shapes from the Tree of Shapes.

This proof of concept implementation includes the Tree of Shapes modification strategies in two and three dimensions, and allows the modificaiton of the structure.

It also includes the computation of the Topological Tree of Shapes from a previously computed Tree of Shapes in two and three dimensions. Reconstruction strategies are implemented.

Pre-requisite: 

Higra version 0.6.12: https://github.com/higra/Higra for preliminary ToS computation.

OmeTiffWriter (https://allencellmodeling.github.io/aicsimageio/aicsimageio.writers.html) or equivalent to save tif files from np array.

Examples of ToS and TToS construction and filtering strategies are included in the notebook.
